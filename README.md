Practice: Employee management

• Create a new class called Employee.
• Create two classes SystemDeveloper and SalesPerson that should inherit from employee.
• When hired each employee has a base salary of 25 000 a month.
• SystemDevelopers get 1000 extra for each certificate they have and 1500 extra for each programming language they work with.
• SalesPersons get 500 extra for each client they maintain and 1000 extra for each new client they have acquired.
• Create method calculateSalary() in Super class and override this method in its subclasses.
• Also make a toString implementation for SystemDevelopers and SalesPerson.
• Whenever they acquire new clients, certificates and languages the salary should update.
